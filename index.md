### Motivation:
The LendingClub platform connects borrowers to investors and facilitates the payment of loans. The basic idea is that borrowers apply for a loan on the LendingClub Marketplace. Investors can review the loan applications, along with risk analysis provided by LendingClub, to determine how much of the loan request they are willing to fund. When the loan is fully funded, the borrower will receive the loan. Investors can also choose to have loans selected manually or automatically via a specified strategy. 

Working as quantitative investors on Wall Street, our passion is to come up with an investment strategy that could maximize our investment return for given level of risk. Loan details such as grade or subgrade, loan purpose, interest rate, and borrower information can all be used to evaluate a loan for possible investment. We want to build prediction models that can accurately forecast the loan-level default probability, so that we can efficiently allocate fund to loans with high return and low risk.
